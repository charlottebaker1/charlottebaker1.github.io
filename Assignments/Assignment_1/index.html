            <h1>I &hearts; Tennis</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Tennis is one of my favorite activites to do in  my free time, although it's hard to do in South Carolina heat. I started playing tennis at age 2 and was the captain of my varsity team in high school. Now I like to play on weekends or whenever I can with friends. Tennis can be difficult because it requires good technique, but when you learn to hit properly it is so fun!</p>
            <br>
            <p>First you should find nice courts to play on, and grab some gear. You only really need a racquet, tennis balls, and someone to play with. But, it is nice to have tennis/athletic clothes. Then you can start playing!/</p>
